# Hyprland configuration file
# Migrated from bspwm and sxhkd

# Please note that this is an automated migration.
# Some of your custom scripts and settings may not work as expected.
# You may need to manually adjust this configuration file.

# Monitors
monitor=,preferred,auto,auto

# Autostart
# You can add your autostart commands here.
# For example:
# exec-once = waybar &
# exec-once = mako &
# exec-once = swaybg -i ~/Pictures/wall.jpg
#
# Your original autostart script is located at:
# ${HOME}/.config/bspwm/autostart
# You may want to review it and migrate the commands to this section.
exec-once = ${HOME}/.config/hypr/autostart &

# sxhkd
# Your sxhkd configuration has been partially migrated to this file.
# However, you have a lot of custom scripts that are called from sxhkd.
# For this reason, sxhkd is still being started.
# You can gradually migrate your keybindings from sxhkd to this file.
# exec-once = sxhkd &

# Environment variables
# You can set environment variables here.
# For example:
# env = XCURSOR_SIZE,24
#
# Your original environment variables are set in:
# ${HOME}/.profile
# You may want to review it and migrate the variables to this section.

# Gaps
# Your bspwm gap settings have been migrated here.
